Play Snake game using Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm (GA)
1. Neural Network for predicting the next action
2. The GA for finding the best chromosomes (here i.e a sets of the weights and biases) as parent populations

## Dependencies:
1. numpy
2. pyqt5
3. Python3.6+

To install dependencies, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage:
1. The main file is `app.py`

2. Neural Network in `network/` directory

3. Genetic Algorithm in `GA/` directory

4. Panels for displaying in `views/` directory

5. Change/modify the settings in `helper/config.py` ( the hyperparameters of the Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm)

6. Run `app.py`
